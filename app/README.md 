# 🇬🇲 Kultur Gambia: Open Source Heritage Project

Welcome to the **Kultur Gambia** open-source community! This project is a digital initiative dedicated to archiving, celebrating, and sharing the rich cultural tapestry of The Gambia—from the ancient stone circles of Wassu to the vibrant festivals of Banjul.

## 🌟 Our Mission
Kultur Gambia is built on the belief that heritage belongs to everyone. By providing a modern, community-driven platform, we aim to:
* **Digitalize Traditions:** Record oral histories, recipes, and music before they are lost.
* **Promote Tourism:** Help travelers discover hidden landmarks and cultural sites.
* **Empower Storytellers:** Give every Gambian a platform to share their local history.

## 📱 Features & User Experience

### **The Discovery Hub (`HomeScreen`)**
The main interface is designed to be an immersive "Digital Museum."


* **Visual Storytelling:** We prioritize high-quality imagery to represent the beauty of the country.
* **Intuitive Navigation:** Use the **Category Slider** to jump between *Food, Music, Festivals,* and more.
* **Staggered Discovery:** Our "Scrapbook" layout (`LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid`) allows users to browse diverse content organically.

### **Community Contributions**
The app is powered by the people. The **"Share Story"** feature allows users to:
1. Upload a cover photo representing their culture.
2. Write a title and a brief summary.
3. Share the full history or instructions (e.g., a Benachin recipe).

## 🛠 Project Structure (For Contributors)

We use a modern Android stack that is beginner-friendly for new open-source contributors:

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Framework** | Jetpack Compose | Modern, declarative UI development. |
| **Image Loading** | Coil | Efficiently loading cultural photos from the web or local assets. |
| **Layouts** | Staggered Grids | Creating a dynamic, Pinterest-style browsing experience. |
| **Theme** | Material 3 | Adhering to the latest Android design standards for accessibility. |



### **Design Tokens**
To keep the app looking professional and consistent, we follow these standards:
* **Rounded Corners:** Cards use `24.dp` for featured items and `20.dp` for grid items.
* **Spacing:** A standard `16.dp` to `20.dp` gutter is used between elements to give the content "room to breathe."
* **Typography:** We use *ExtraBold* headlines to give the app a strong, confident identity.
